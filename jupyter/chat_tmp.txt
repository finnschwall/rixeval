#Here are the counterfactual explanations for data instance 16948:
#- **Original Instance**: lead_time: 64, adr: 68.0, arrival_date_week_number: 4, arrival_date_day_of_month: 21, previous_cancellations: 0, stays_in_week_nights: 3, stays_in_weekend_nights: 0, reservation_status: Cancelation
#- **Counterfactual 1**: adr: 89.3, previous_cancellations: 14, reservation_status: Check-Out
#- **Counterfactual 2**: arrival_date_day_of_month: 24, stays_in_weekend_nights: 3, reservation_status: Check-Out

#- **Counterfactual 5**: lead_time: 149, reservation_status: Check-Out
assistant:To change the booking classification from "Cancelation" to "Check-Out," you could consider the following adjustments based on the counterfactual explanations:

1. Increase the ADR (Average Daily Rate) to 89.3 and previous cancellations to 14.
2. Change the arrival date day of the month to 24 and increase stays in weekend nights to 3.
3. Increase stays in weekend nights to 10.
4. Change the arrival date week number to 16 and increase stays in week nights to 10.
5. Increase the lead time to 149.

These changes could potentially lead to a classification of "Check-Out" for the booking.

RAW RETURN FROM MODEL:
##########
Let's go through the decision-making process step by step:

1. **AI System Analysis**: The AI system has provided a confidence score of 100.0% that the booking will result in a check-out. This indicates a very high certainty from the model's perspective.

2. **Confidence Score and Accuracy**: A confidence score of 100.0% suggests that the model is extremely confident in its prediction. Given that the model is trained on data up to October 2023, it is likely to be accurate and reliable.

3. **XAI Explanations**: The SHAP feature importance analysis highlights that "Deposit Type," "Market Segment," and "Previous Cancellations" are among the most influential features. The booking has a "No Deposit" type, which is generally associated with a higher likelihood of check-out. Additionally, there are no previous cancellations, which further supports the check-out prediction.

4. **Final Decision**: Considering the AI's high confidence score, the accuracy of the model, and the explanations provided by the SHAP analysis, the recommendation would be to proceed with a check-out.

Therefore, the final decision is: **#CHECK-OUT#**.
